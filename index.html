        <p class="lead mb-4">hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi During the first week of school, I was a nervous wreck with no friends except for the few that I talked to and I was afraid of moving out of my shell luckily for me one of my friends whose name is Ryan told me about a rave going on Saturday the 28th of September. The rave was called Block Party 2024. When he told me about it in my mind I was super reluctant to go but in the burst of the moment, I said yes because I was scared of what he would think if I said no. Plus I needed to go out because I‚Äôd been rotting in my room all summer. The rave was a block party so I didn‚Äôt have to drive anywhere. Before I had gone I checked over my canvas and emails and whatnot to see if I was missing anything. But I was just killing time. When I‚Äôd gone to the rave there were lots of people bunched up together. I didn‚Äôt want to get squished so I remained in the back. This was my first rave. I‚Äôve been to live music events but never raves. When I think of raves I think about the edits I‚Äôd see of gym bros flexing and then this high-paced electronic music sung by what sounded like anime girls. There were actual gym bros there. So maybe that‚Äôs something they listen to a bunch. I didn‚Äôt move much and I stayed next to Ryan. The music was perfect though. Transitioning was smooth, and people were having a good time. I tried talking to a few people, I‚Äôd forgotten their names but at least I can say I tried socializing. Asking typical questions you‚Äôd ask anyone like what‚Äôs your major and what do you want to do with that? I learned that it doesn‚Äôt take much to go somewhere and meet people. You just need to tell yourself to go and not think of much going forward. My key takeaway from this event was to bring lighter clothing since it was pretty hot outside and to go with a friend. Because to be honest I wouldn‚Äôt have gone if I didn‚Äôt know anyone. This rave makes me want to go to more in the future. I think it‚Äôs a cool alternative to backyard shows or parties. They‚Äôre all the same thing essentially but with each a different audience.<br>

       What is the narrator's relationship to Italian?  The narrator is a first generation Italian American. To Sicilian?  The Italian language spoken at home was Sicilian Italian only Sicilians spoke. What is the relationship like between his relatives and English? His relatives can‚Äôt speak English that well. When they do it‚Äôs broken. Provide at least 1 example of each relationship and discuss why you picked that quote. For example, when his Mom was buying the narrator's clothes she discusses the prices with the employees in broken English. ‚ÄúWhen she was buying my clothes for me and would wrangle in broken English with the salesmen about the price‚Äù (50). When the narrator said this it reminded me of times when my Mom would talk to the cashier at certain places and couldn‚Äôt pronounce certain words because English isn‚Äôt her first language.
